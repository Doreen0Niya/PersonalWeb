            Hello, This is Niya's personal website. Welcome! I am a current Computer Science undergraduate student in the University of California San Diego who is seeking internship opportunities. I am working toward the Computer Science BS degree with the passion for new knowledge and with the urge to practice the learned skills. I am able to grasp and understand new information or techniques and can adapt to the working position quickly. 
            <br>The main purpose for this site is to introduce myself and provides the details of the projects that I have worked on so far. I hope to include both words and visual information in the "Experience/Projects" section and provide all other resources in the "Resources" section.
            <br>The site is currently under development since I am still learning how to build up a website. Please expect more to come in the near future.</p>
